The naming convention of the ascii files is the following:

Spectral type + Band + Gravity

Gravity can be 'f' (field objects) or 'lg' (low gravity objects).

So, for instance, L1H_f.txt is the template for the H band of the field L1 objects.

Columns are:

1. Wavelength in microns
2. Average normalized flux
3. Normalized flux standard deviation
4. Min normalized flux
5. Max normalized flux

The last two columns define the range of the strip at each wavelength.
